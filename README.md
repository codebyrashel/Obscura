# Project Epika

## Overview

Project Epika is an open-source initiative currently in the planning and conceptualization phase. Its mission is to create a scalable, accessible, and impactful platform for writers and artists in the fields of manga, manhwa, manhua, and storytelling. The platform is envisioned to act as both a creative hub and a social ecosystem where creators can share work, collaborate on projects, and build communities without financial barriers.

Unlike existing platforms that focus either narrowly on artwork or on fragmented communities, Project Epika intends to integrate the entire creative workflow into one seamless experience. Writers, illustrators, and readers will coexist in a collaborative environment designed for growth, discovery, and long-term sustainability.

It is important to note that all details outlined in this document are subject to change as the project evolves. Project Epika is not yet finalized in scope, branding, or implementation.

2. Offer a free-to-access platform to reduce entry barriers for new talent.
3. Create a collaborative ecosystem where artists and writers can connect, brainstorm, and co-develop creative works.
4. Provide scalable social media-like functionality such as posting, liking, following, and sharing.
5. Incorporate future-proof features including community events, mentorship opportunities, AI-assisted tools, and portfolio integration.
6. Maintain a simple, clean, and appealing user interface for global accessibility.
